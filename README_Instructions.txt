Voter Registration Project 2020 Beta:

Prerequisites:
	- You must have Mozilla Firefox installed: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
	
Setup:
	- Run the provided setup.exe
	- Follow the installer's directions
	- Ensure that you install this to a place where you have file-write access. (The default Desktop location should be fine).

Instructions:
	- Run MapTheVoteAddressBuilder.exe. It should have a "Vote" icon.
	- This will open up a console window and an instance of Firefox. Do not interact with it until instructed to do so.
	- Wait for the program to log in to MapTheVote and ask for you to select a marker.
	- In MapTheVote, zoom and scroll around until you have map markers in view. They should look like small green circles.
	- Select a map marker and wait for the program to take over.
	- The program will then start querying addressed and automatically register users for you. No further interaction is required. You are free to minimize everything and/or walk away from your computer.
	- In the event where the program encounters a fatal error or can't find anymore unregistered voters, It will ask you to hit "Y" to retry, or any other key to exit.
	- On exiting, you should see a handful of COMBINED_Addresses__________.txt files. These are the addresses where applications were sent to.
	- Feel free to delete any COMBINED_Addresses.txt and/or Addresses______.combined files once you've submitted the .txt file, or once the program has told you that they've been submitted.
	
Notes:
	- Check on this program every 30-60 minutes. While in beta, there are some bugs that may require you to reselect a marker or restart the application.
	
Please let us know if you run into any issues.
